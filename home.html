                <p>Grow Green is a social enterprise aiming to create a positive change in the environment by promoting
                    sustainable products which efficiently replaces products made from and packaged with plastics. Our
                    products are made with love from bamboo andare unbleached, thus not harming the environment from any
                    angle. The packaging of our products are made from recycled paper, which is biodegradable and even
                    compostable.</p>

                <p>We work towards the issue of sustainability from many angles. We have found that nearly everything we
                    touch can be replaced by a more eco-friendly product that does not have to go to the landfills or be
                    incarcerated - both toxic for the environment, but can be turned into compost in your own
                    backyard.
                </p>

                <p>Our platform also aims to change the way our society shops by eliminating plastics from packaging,
                    even
                    though the product is offered with greater convenience and style.
                </p>

                <p>For every product that you purchase from us, a part of your money will go towards equipping rural and
                    marginalized households with sustainable alternative technologies which replaces firewood as the
                    fuel to
                    cook.

                <h2 class="heading">Why Bamboo?</h2>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Eco-friendly. It is possible to grow bamboo without fertilizers and pesticides. After all, it
                        has a tough
                        outer
                        coating and grows very fast.</li>
                    <li>Strong and flexible. The reasons bamboo is widely used is its strength and flexibility. As
                        furniture
                        materials,
                        bamboo has the ability to bend and is comfortable to sit on.</li>
                    <li>Lightweight. Due to its very lightweight bamboo is very easy to move around. It doesnâ€™t matter
                        how big the
                        cabinets, benches or tables are. Moving the furniture is very easy.</li>
                    <li>Practical and comfortable. As a fabric, bamboo has thermal regulating abilities, is odor
                        resistant, and
                        highly
                        breathable.</li>
                    <li>Easy to maintain. All types of bamboo products are usually very smooth due to its natural oil
                        coating.
                        Bamboo is
                        also very easy to clean.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="heading">Why Choose Grow Green?</h2>
                <p>Going green is "environmentally friendly decision to "reduce, reuse and recycle." Green products are made from organic and 
                    biodegradable materials and are designed to use least non-renewable resources and toxic chemicals to produce energy. 
                    This reduces the generation of greenhouse gases like CFCs, Ozone, methane etc. and hence prevents pollution and deterioration 
                    of climatic.
